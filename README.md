### Advancing Knowledge Discoveries in Criminal Investigations with Semantic Textual Similarity

This repo contains the necessary files to produce the numbers used for the paper.

The folders are organized as:
- kripos
    - 3 steps for creating the embeddings and index to apply semantic search operations on the data.
    - As data is strictly confidential, we cannot share the data used for the experiments. However, we supply a dataset of 100 court decisions from Lovdata.
- lovdata
    - 3 steps, similar to above, to reproduce the stats and figure in the paper.
- models
    - helpers for various models tested throughout the work.
